<p>This is a quickstart for building your VSCode webview extension with Svelte</p>
<p>Some files and folders for you to look out for:</p>
<p>src/extension/extension.ts --- Your base extension file for VSCode</p>
<p>src/extension/ --- Place all TypeScript files relating to your backend here!</p>
<p>src/App.svelte --- This is your webview page</p>
<p>src/components/ --- Place your components here</p>
<p>src/app.css --- Your base CSS file</p>
<p>You can place TypeScript files that relate to the frontend anywhere in the src directory.</p>
